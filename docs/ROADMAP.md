## What We're Deliberately NOT Building (Yet)

- Investment account aggregation (Plaid for investments) — regulatory complexity
- Tax-loss harvesting advice — requires RIA licence
- Social Security optimizer — relevant only for 50+ users (not core persona)
- Estate planning — out of scope
- Advisor marketplace — not aligned with direct-to-consumer positioning
- Native mobile app — web-first until product-market fit is proven
